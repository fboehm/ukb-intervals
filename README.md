This is the repository for the analysis of UK biobank traits.
Specifically, our goal is to calculate prediction intervals for the predicted 
trait values.

Xiang suggested first quantile normalizing the traits. Let's do that first.

We'll run the scripts, with minor modifications, of Sheng Yang from the comparisonProject directory.

## Documenting Sheng's files

I copied the `code` subdirectory from Sheng's comparisonProject directory. 

I now aim to document his code.

I want to have code that starts with the "raw" data from ukb, ie, the downloaded data.
