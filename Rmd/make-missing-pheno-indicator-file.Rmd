## Overview

We create a text file containing a single column of zeroes and ones. The number of rows equals 
the number of rows in the fam file. For a single trait, we need to know which subjects have 
missing values for the trait of interest.


## Read the fam file

```{r}
fam <- readr::read_table(file = "/net/mulan/disk2/yasheng/predictionProject/plink_file/ukb/chr22.fam", col_names = FALSE)
trait_num <- 1
indic <- is.na(fam[, 5 + trait_num])
readr::write_csv(x = tibble::as_tibble(as.numeric(indic)), file = paste0("trait_", trait_num, "_missingness_indicator.txt"))

```
