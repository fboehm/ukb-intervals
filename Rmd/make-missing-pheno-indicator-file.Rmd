## Overview

We read the two files - per trait - from Sheng Yang. They tell us which subjects 
belong to training and test sets. Note that subjects that are in the test (or 
training) set have nonmissing trait values. Those with NAs are not in the respective 
set.

## Read the phenotype files from Sheng

```{r}
train <- readr::read_table(file = "/net/mulan/disk2/yasheng/comparisonProject/02_pheno/02_train_c/pheno_pheno1.txt", col_names = FALSE)
test <- readr::read_table(file = "/net/mulan/disk2/yasheng/comparisonProject/02_pheno/03_test_c/pheno_pheno1.txt", col_names = FALSE)
cross <- 1
indic <- as.numeric(!is.na(test[, cross]))

readr::write_csv(x = tibble::as_tibble(as.numeric(indic)), file = paste0("trait_", trait_num, "_cross_", cross, "_test-set_indicator.txt"), col_names = FALSE)

```
