## Overview

We create a text file containing a single column of zeroes and ones. The number of rows equals 
the number of rows in the fam file. For a single trait, we need to know which subjects have 
missing values.


## Read the fam file

```{r}
fam <- readr::read_table(file = "/net/mulan/disk2/yasheng/predictionProject/plink_file/ukb/chr22.fam")
```
