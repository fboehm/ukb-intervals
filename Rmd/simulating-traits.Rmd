We want to use GCTA software to simulate quantitative traits. Here is the
documentation: https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/#GWASSimulation

It's unclear to me how to specify the error distribution. Actually, the default error distribution is ok. What is more concerning is the effect size distribution. let's use R to simulate the effect sizes from the distributions that Sheng lists in the DBSLMM paper. We can then save them as text files for use with GCTA, via the `--simu-causal-loci` flag.
