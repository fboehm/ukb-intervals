```

We want to read a collection of variance.txt files for analysis of a single trait. Within the results directory, we have a separate subdir for each phenotype, like pheno1. 

Within each phenotype's subdir, we have the files "summary_ukb_cross_variance_chr.txt", where the cross number and chromosome number are included in the file names. 

```{r}
library(magrittr)
inputs <- tibble::tibble(phe_num = rep(1:25, each = 5), cross_num = rep(1:5, times = 25))
res <- list()
for (i in 1:nrow(inputs)){
res[[i]] <- knitr::knit_child(
    "calculating-coverage-child.Rmd", envir = globalenv(), quiet = TRUE
  )
}
cat(unlist(res), sep = '\n')
```
