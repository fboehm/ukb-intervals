## Xiang's method with `qqnorm` and `sample`

## `ryouready::qqnorm_spss`

`base::qqnorm` has no comparable argument.

It seems that we want to set `ties.method = "random"` for our analyses.

if ( git2r::in_repository() ) {
        summary(git2r::last_commit()) 
 } else { 
        message("We are not in a git repository") 
 }
```

```{r}
devtools::session_info()
