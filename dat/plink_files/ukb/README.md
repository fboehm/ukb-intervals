## README

On Nov 17 2021, I created the subdirectory modified_fam to contain the 
fam files with 'extra' traits for input to GEMMA. Specifically, 
the 'extra traits' are for the training and test sets. They have NAs 
for the set complements.

On Jan 14 2022, I deleted the modified_fam subdir and its contents. It had
become obsolete.
